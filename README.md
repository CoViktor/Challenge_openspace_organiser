# 💺💺💺 Openspace Organiser Challenge 💺💺💺
A small program to ameliorate organisational culture.

## Description 🔔

This program was designed as a way for organisations to increase the atmosphere in their teams. 
In order to better get to know everybody, employees are encouraged to daily switch seats and work side by side
with new people.

This program takes as input a number of tables in a room, as well as the amount of chairs at each table.
A list of names can then be provided (manually or via a CSV file).

Each time the program is run, the names will be shuffled and new seats will be assigned and saved in an excel file.

Enjoy meeting everybody! 😁

## Installation 🚧

The program is run in python and a few dependencies are used.
Simply press 'windows + R'copy paste and enter the following lines.
`pip install CSV`
`pip install openpyxl`

## Usage ✔️
Only 'main.py' should be used to run this code.
An openspace creation, the organizing of the seats, and the storage of the output are already prepared in the template.
Instructions for personalisation are provided in the script.

## Timeline ⌚
This project was created over the timespan of 2 days.

## Personal situation 🙋
This is my first personal project created during the BeCode AI and Datascience training.
The goal of this project was to implement a usecase for what was learned during the first two weeks of our training.
Learning by trial and error excites me, and this was a great way to learn new stuff and ingrain some things into my brain.
